    index = words.find_index("is") # Identifying the index value of the element "is" in the array
    words[index + 1]  # Calling the array element after the "is" element identified in the line above. Object type is an array element.

reviews.each do |review| # Setting up the block, with the each method (iterating through each element in the array), with a parameter
  adjectives << find_adjective(review) # Executes the find_adjective method on each element in the reviews array. Adds the result to the adjectives array.
end
p adjectives # prints the adjectives array. It should be an array with the adjective (word after "is") of each element in the filtered reviews array
